# Femtosecond_Mass_Spectrometry
We present a cryogenicgenic mass spectrometry protocol with a capability of attomoles peptide detection from frozen aqueous films with low-intensity femtosecond pulses. The python code written for this project is publicallly available here.

Another script is used to evaluate and present peptide fragments obtained during the experiment.
