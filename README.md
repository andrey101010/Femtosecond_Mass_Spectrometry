# Femtosecond_Mass_Spectrometry
We present a cryogenicgenic mass spectrometry protocol with a capability of attomoles peptide detection from frozen aqueous films with low-intensity femtosecond pulses. The python code written for this project is publicallly available here.

Mass spectra of bradykinin under cryogenic conditions at different temeperatures. Overall 175 nl of a 100 μM analyte solution were pipetted. A) Mass spectra produced by 513 nm irradiation with an average pulse energy of 16.8 μJ. In total, 441 shots were averaged to a single mass spectrum. The asterisk in the figure marks bradykinin position for all traces. B) Corresponding 2D images of bradykinin signal created on an area of 5x3 mm (x and y). The blue box indicates 1 mm.

# Fragmentation
Another script is used to evaluate and present peptide fragments obtained during the experiment.
